# awsm: active objects with state machines.

Awsm is an event-driven framework for real-time concurrency in
embedded systems, written in Nim. It provides an event-driven runtime
with hierarchical state machines, suitable for resource-constrained
processors with no Memory Management Units (MMU).

This is a rewrite of the concepts of Miro Samek's
[QP Framework](https://www.state-machine.com/)
and not a verbatim translation.  I'm taking advantage of Nim's features
(e.g. strong type system, automatic memory management) where they are valuable.

## Existing Features

- Active Objects: Each Awsm eschews a thread stack in favor of Run-To-Completion (RTC)
  semantics and an event queue which serializes processing.
- Hierarchical State Machines: Supports nested states and transitions
  for automating behavior.

## Planned Features

- Active objects can:
  * process an event atomically and serially from its event queue
  * change its own event handler for the next event
  * spawn child Awsms
  * post events to child Awsms
  * publish events system wide
- Event Dispatching: Efficient event handling and state transitions.
- Customizable Value Size: Choose between 16, 32, or 64-bit event values at compile time.

## Getting Started
